#DDBreakpoints Overview

This repo is home to our Breakpoints SCSS Mixin and JavaScript. We use this to simplify creating responsive websites.

We were inspired to create DDBreakpoints back in May 2013 by Chris Coyier's CSS-Tricks article [Naming Media Queries](http://css-tricks.com/naming-media-queries/)

As we built more responsive websites our philosophy of creating responsive sites that don't look responsive (i.e. don't use a predictable standard grid) meant that we need to add more and more breakpoints.

While we always followed the mobile first mentality, sometimes we would find that we'll need to add an "and-below" breakpoint for edge cases, so our breakpoints mixin was getting overly large and repetitively complex.

Hence, DDBreakpoints was born in late 2013 and is now used on every responsive project by Deloitte Digital in Australia, and now, available for your projects too.
